Simple Movie Site
=====================

The goals of this project are:
1. Dump directories of files & run script to create site.
2. Static website; rebuild to find new files.
3. Self-contained, no CDNs.
4. Allow for "overrides" & tags of Movies via config files.

Not sure the language to write the script.  Just making the general layout and navigation right now.

What is up so far
------------------
Right now:
* Some ideas thrown together for JSON for config files.
* Sample page for video HTML tag.
* Sample page for player window using blaze.min.css.
